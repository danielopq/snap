## Overview
    This Landing page involved responsive frontend development featuring a customized dropdown navigation with icons, specifically designed for a website dedicated to remote work teams. The design is optimized for both desktop (1440px) and mobile (375px) views, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.

    The navigation component enhances usability by allowing users to easily access various sections of the site, with icons providing intuitive visual cues. The layout and elements are meticulously arranged according to the provided images, maintaining consistency with the intended design.

    The website is built using standard web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, with no frameworks or libraries used. This approach allows for greater control over the codebase and ensures that the website remains lightweight and efficient.

## My process

I developed the website initially with a focus on the desktop version to ensure a robust and feature-rich user experience. Once all the elements were in place and aligned with the design requirements, I proceeded to adapt the layout for the mobile version using only a CSS media query. This step involved carefully rearranging and resizing elements to ensure optimal usability on smaller screens while preserving the overall aesthetic.

After confirming that the mobile design met the necessary standards, I shifted my focus to enhancing interactivity by implementing JavaScript actions. This phase involved creating dynamic features such as dropdown menus and responsive buttons, which significantly improved user engagement. By carefully organizing the JavaScript functionality, I ensured smooth transitions and a cohesive experience as users navigated through the website.

Overall, this project allowed me to apply my skills in responsive design and JavaScript programming, resulting in a fully functional website that caters effectively to both desktop and mobile users.
